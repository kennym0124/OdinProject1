        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Since starting a weight lifting diet, protein has been my key nutrient.</p>
            <p>I love adding protein to some of my daily staples. I've done it with our morning bagels and our evening pasta. I recently tried the Quest protein pizza and while it was tasty, it was SUPER expensive. It also was such a tiny portion that I needed to make my own!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>High protein self rising flour</li>
                <li>Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Italian seasonings</li>
                <li>Toppings of choice - Low fat cheese, turkey pepperoni, vegetables, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by adding the flour, yogurt, salt, and Italian seasonings into a mixing bowl and mixing togehter until a smooth dough remains. If the dough is too sticky, add a little extra flour. If the dough is too thick, add a touch more yogurt.</li>
                <li>Next, lightly flour a flat surface and transfer the dough on top. Using your hands, gently knead the dough several times, before rolling it out into a pizza shape.</li>
                <li>Now, transfer the pizza dough onto a pizza tray or stone. Brush the crust with some olive oil, then spread some tomato sauce (pizza sauce) on top, followed by your favorite toppings. Bake the pizza in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the crust is golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven, slice it up, and enjoy immediately.</li>
            </ol>
